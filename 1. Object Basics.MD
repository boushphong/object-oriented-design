## Object definition
An object represents an individual, identifiable item, unit or entity, either real or abstract, with a well defined role in the problem domain

- Model some part of reality
- Exists in space and time
- Can be invented as outcome of design process
- Has Well-defined behaviour and definite purpose
- Collaborate with other objects to provide a higher-level behaviour

### Designing Object Tips

- Don't overdesign things that may be useful in the future, when such a component arrives
- NO DESIGN is bad.
- Develop iteratively, keep things simple, design such that objects are flexible easily extended.
- Class names should be `Nouns` based on their `intent`.

## Object Charateristics
has:
- State
- Identity
- Behaviour

The structure and behaviour of similar objects are specified in a class
- Object is an instance of such class
- A class is the blueprint for objects

Forms the building block of an application

### State
- Properties and their values constitute the state of an object
- Appear as attributes of an object (fields, member variables, etc)
- Can be of two types
  - **static** — fundamental attributes that don’t change
    - Power
    - No. of speakers (2, 21, 4.1, etc)
    - Connectivity
    - Color
    - Brand
    - Serial no.
  - **dynamic** — attributes that change as a result of operation performed on the object
    - Volume
    - Treble
    - Bass

#### Cellphone Example
- **static**
  - CPU
  - Storage size
  - Display size
  - Supported Bands
  - OS
  - IMEI number
- **Dynamic**
  - State (standby, in-call)
  - Remaining storage
  - Battery level
  - Signal Strength

### Identity

- Trait that makes an object unique and gives it individuality
- Represented through one or more attributes of the object
  - Address of an object can be used to represent its identity in some cases
- Helps identify objects in a system
- Examples:
  - Speaker System - Serial no.
  - Cellphone - IMEI no.
  - Person - Social Security no.

### Behaviour

- Objects carry out behaviour in response to messages they receive.
- Response of the object during interaction
- Part of the responsibbility of an object
- Arises due to binding between attributes and operations
  - Operations will internally change the state of the object
  - This culminates into the behaviour of the object
- Appear as operations (member functions, methods)
- Examples:
  - Speaker System - `changeVolumn`, `changeBass`, `changeTreble`, `EqualizeLoudness`
  - Cellphone - `sendText`, `dial`, `acceptCall`, `connect`
