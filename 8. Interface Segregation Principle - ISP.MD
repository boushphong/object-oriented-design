## Interface Segregation Principle
- No clients should be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
- This often becomes a problem when `clients` have dependencies on what we call those fat classes (classes that have too many responsibilities)
- Having an interface to separate behavior is a good idea, and it prevents tight coupling between between the objects.
### Example

#### Diagram B (Bad Design)

- In this logic, what if the `Substitude Teacher` is not allowed to teach (maybe monitoring students are their responsibility) . Teaching in this case is the responsibility of the main teacher.

- In this case, a violation of the `Interface Segregation Principle` would be to have a substitute teacher or inherit from the teacher class because as as as for our definition, which means the `SubstituteTeacher` also have to implement the **_teach()_** method (like the diagram below). However in our logic, Substitute teachers don't actually teach. So this does not fall into this particular hierarchy because it is not really a teacher as per our definition.

We can however handle this probem by throwing a customer `CannotTeachException`. So we're actually throwing this cannot teach exception in the body of the teach method like so.

```java
public class CannotTeachException extends Exception {
    
}
```

```java
public class SubstitudeTeacher extends Teacher {
    @Override
    public void teach() {
        throw new CannotTeachException();
    }
}
```

This is **BAD** because we have to add the exception to the teacher class like so.

```java
public abstract class Teacher {
    public abstract void teach() throw CannotTeachException; // <- Forcing changes on parent class by having to add an exception here
    
    private void makeAnnoucements() {
        ...
    }
    
    ...
    
    public void performOtherResponsibilites() {
        makeAnnoucements();
        takeAttendence();
        ...
    }
    
}
```

- Now notice how the subclass is forcing change in its parent. Now in the definition of this abstract method we would actually have to throw the new exception. So this is unacceptable we should never force upon a parent class changes because things don't work out in the subclasses
- Throwing an exception like this is an `Anti-Pattern`.

### Solution
- The solution [Good Design](#diagram-A) to this whole mess would be to pull out a substitute teacher from this inheritance relationship because it simply is not a teacher as per our definition of what a teacher what a real teacher whose behavior should be.
- We broken out the responsibility of teaching to a particular interface called CourseInstructor and the general responsibilities that all high school staff members should have is encapsulated in the `SchoolStaff` abstract class.

In this school staff abstract class:

```java
public class SchoolStaff extends Employ {
    private void makeAnnouncements() {
        System.out.println("made announcements..");
    }
    private void takeAttendence() {
        System.out.println("took attendence..");
    }
    private void collectPaperWork() {
        System.out.println("collected paperwork..");
    }
    private void conductHallwayDuties() {
        System.out.println("conducted hallway duties..");
    }

    public void performOtherResponsibilities() {
        makeAnnouncements();
        takeAttendence();
        collectPaperWork();
        conductHallwayDuties();;
    }
}
```

```java
public interface CourseInstructor {
    public void teach();
}
```

```java
public class EnglishTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements CourseInstructor {

    @Override
    public void teach() {
        System.out.println("Taught English");
    }
}
```

```java
public class MathTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements CourseInstructor {

    @Override
    public void teach() {
        System.out.println("Taught Math");
    }
}
```

```java
public class ScienceTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements CourseInstructor {

    @Override
    public void teach() {
        System.out.println("taught science");
    }
}
```

```java
public class SubstituteTeacher extends SchoolStaff {

}
```

## Take-away

`Interface Segregation Principle` is all about segregating interfaces and make them smaller. Whenever you have an Interface, you need everything that implements that Interface to use every portion of the Interface.

Eg.
- It doensn't make sense for a `Turret` Object to be able to access methods such as **_move_** even though **_move_** could be left unimplemented in the `turret` Object. Hence, the `Turret` Object should only inherit the `GameObject` interface, and not inherit the `Moveable` interface.
