## Forming Associations

- It's better to design associations between objects based on the object behaviour rathar than the physical flow in the real world.

### Example

```java
public class NewspaperCompany {
    Customer customer;
    
    public void setCustomer(Customer aCustomer) {
        customer = aCustomer;
    }
}
```

- The newspaper company has an instance of customer so it expects a customer object to be handed to it so that it can perform operations on that object.
- The `NewspaperCompany` Object implies a `has a` relationship with the `Customer` Object, which means newspaper company would need customer(s) to be able to send messages to.
- This resembles very much the physical flow in the real world.

**However this exposes an error**

The physical flow of papers in this case is actually irrelevant to the behavior that the object should have. So this association might work just OK until the customer decides to cancel his newspaper subscription. At that time the customer would like to be able to tell the newspaper company to stop sending the papers.
