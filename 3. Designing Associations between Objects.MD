## Forming Associations

- It's better to design associations between objects based on the object behaviour rathar than the physical flow in the real world.

### Example

<img width="666" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59940078/205904159-00d1ed4e-512c-4cd6-b47c-3dbc8f10471d.png">

```java
public class NewspaperCompany {
    Customer customer;
    
    public void setCustomer(Customer aCustomer) {
        customer = aCustomer;
    }
}
```

- The newspaper company has an instance of customer so it expects a customer object to be handed to it so that it can perform operations on that object.
- The `NewspaperCompany` Object implies a `has a` relationship with the `Customer` Object, which means newspaper company would need customer(s) to be able to send messages to.
- This resembles very much the physical flow in the real world.

**However this exposes an error**

The physical flow of papers in this case is actually irrelevant to the behavior that the object should have. So this association might work just **OK** until the customer decides to cancel his newspaper subscription. At that time the customer would like to be able to tell the newspaper company to stop sending the papers. Hence, it's better to design it like the following:

<img width="672" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59940078/205905692-3a8e9328-3c00-42e4-8270-db9f0d1ca9c6.png">

```java
public class Customer {
    NewspaperCompany paperCompany;
    
    public void setNewsPaperCompany(NewspaperCompany aNewspaperCompany) {
        paperCompany = aNewspaperCompany;
    }
    
    public void cancelSubscription() {
        paperCompany.stopPaperDelivery();
    }
}
```

- `Customer` objects each contain an instance of newspaper company and to stop receiving papers all the customer would have to do is send the stop paper delivery message to its instance of `NewspaperCompany` object. This is assuming that the **_stopPaperDelivery_** method is defined in the `NewspaperCompany` class definition.

### It's better to design association that would align well with the behaviour of the application rather than physcial flow.
