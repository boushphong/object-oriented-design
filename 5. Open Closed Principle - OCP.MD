## Open Closed Principle

- Software entities such as classes methods and packages are generally speaking software modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- In other words software should be designed in such a way that new functionality should cause minimum changes to already working and tested code.
- In the development lifecycle, new requirements continue to pour in and if the developers are forced to constantly change the already completed and tested modules to support new requirements the design is considered fragile. Ideally developers should be able to change the environment surrounding a module rather than changing the module itself.

### This principle is very relevant to software testing
- When unit tests are passing for existing software functionality, The cost of modifying those fully functioning and well tested components to support new requirements is quite high. Not only must you modify already working code. You also have to modify those test cases that you wrote. Things can break where you least expect. So the `Open Closed Principle` saves developers from fragile design.

## Extending the example from Part 4. SRP

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Doctor extends Employee {

    public Doctor(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        super(id, name, department, working);
        System.out.println("Doctor in action...");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Nurse extends Employee {

    public Nurse(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        super(id, name, department, working);
        System.out.println("Nurse in action...");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

import javax.print.Doc;

public class HospitalManagement {

    public void callUpon(Employee employee) {
        if (employee instanceof Nurse) {
            checkVitalSigns();
            drawblood();
            cleanPatientArea();
        } else if (employee instanceof Doctor) {
            presribeMedicine();
            diagnosePatient();
        }
    }
    // Nurses
    private void checkVitalSigns() {
        System.out.println("Checking Vitals");
    }

    private void drawblood() {
        System.out.println("Drawing bloods");
    }

    private void cleanPatientArea() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning patient area");
    }

    // Doctors
    private void presribeMedicine() {
        System.out.println("Prescribe Medicine");
    }

    private void diagnosePatient() {
        System.out.println("Diagnose Patient");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class EmergencyRoomProcess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HospitalManagement ERDirector = new HospitalManagement();
        Employee peggy = new Nurse(1, "Peggy", "Emergency", true);
        ERDirector.callUpon(peggy);

        Employee suzan = new Doctor(2, "Suzan", "Emergency", true);
        ERDirector.callUpon(suzan);
    }
}
```
