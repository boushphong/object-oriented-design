## Open Closed Principle

- Software entities such as classes methods and packages are generally speaking software modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- In other words software should be designed in such a way that new functionality should cause minimum changes to already working and tested code.
- In the development lifecycle, new requirements continue to pour in and if the developers are forced to constantly change the already completed and tested modules to support new requirements the design is considered fragile. Ideally developers should be able to change the environment surrounding a module rather than changing the module itself.

### This principle is very relevant to software testing
- When unit tests are passing for existing software functionality, The cost of modifying those fully functioning and well tested components to support new requirements is quite high. Not only must you modify already working code. You also have to modify those test cases that you wrote. Things can break where you least expect. So the `Open Closed Principle` saves developers from fragile design.

- _Open for extension_ means that you should be able to add new functionality to a software entity without modifying its existing code. In other words, you should be able to extend its behavior by adding new code rather than changing existing code.

- _Closed for modification_ means that the existing code of a software entity should not be changed once it has been tested and deployed. In other words, the behavior of a software entity should be fixed and stable, and any changes should be made by adding new code.

## Extending the example from Part 4. SRP

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private boolean working;

    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.working = working;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", department='" + department + '\'' +
                ", working=" + working +
                '}';
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Doctor extends Employee {

    public Doctor(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        super(id, name, department, working);
        System.out.println("Doctor in action...");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Nurse extends Employee {

    public Nurse(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        super(id, name, department, working);
        System.out.println("Nurse in action...");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

import javax.print.Doc;

public class HospitalManagement {

    public void callUpon(Employee employee) {
        if (employee instanceof Nurse) {
            checkVitalSigns();
            drawblood();
            cleanPatientArea();
        } else if (employee instanceof Doctor) {
            presribeMedicine();
            diagnosePatient();
        }
    }
    // Nurses
    private void checkVitalSigns() {
        System.out.println("Checking Vitals");
    }

    private void drawblood() {
        System.out.println("Drawing bloods");
    }

    private void cleanPatientArea() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning patient area");
    }

    // Doctors
    private void presribeMedicine() {
        System.out.println("Prescribe Medicine");
    }

    private void diagnosePatient() {
        System.out.println("Diagnose Patient");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class EmergencyRoomProcess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HospitalManagement ERDirector = new HospitalManagement();
        Employee peggy = new Nurse(1, "Peggy", "Emergency", true);
        ERDirector.callUpon(peggy);

        Employee suzan = new Doctor(2, "Suzan", "Emergency", true);
        ERDirector.callUpon(suzan);
    }
}
```

**_This is a BAD design_**

The code above violates SRP principle. `HospitalManagement` Object should not be responsible for Nurses and Doctors behaviours.

#### Problems
- Let's say requirements came in to also support the work done by the hospital CEO or department directors or janitors and security guards. This class would quickly become messy with many many more instance of conditionals. This class already knows way too much. It knows what doctors and nurses do. And pretty soon it will know the duties of many other employees in the hospital if we leave it as is.
- `Open Closed Principle` states that software modules should be open for extension and closed for modification.
- This class is a big violator of the `Open Closed Principle` because instead of being closed for modification, this class would actually invite and need modification to support other employees doing work at the hospital.

## New CODE

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

abstract public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private boolean working;

    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.working = working;
    }

    public abstract void performDuties();

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", department='" + department + '\'' +
                ", working=" + working +
                '}';
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Nurse extends Employee {

    public Nurse(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        super(id, name, department, working);
        System.out.println("Nurse in action...");
    }

    @Override
    public void performDuties() {
        checkVitalSigns();
        drawblood();
        cleanPatientArea();
    }

    private void checkVitalSigns() {
        System.out.println("Checking Vitals");
    }

    private void drawblood() {
        System.out.println("Drawing bloods");
    }

    private void cleanPatientArea() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning patient area");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class Doctor extends Employee {

    public Doctor(int id, String name, String department, boolean working) {
        super(id, name, department, working);
        System.out.println("Doctor in action...");
    }

    @Override
    public void performDuties() {
        presribeMedicine();
        diagnosePatient();
    }

    private void presribeMedicine() {
        System.out.println("Prescribe Medicine");
    }

    private void diagnosePatient() {
        System.out.println("Diagnose Patient");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class HospitalManagement {

    public void callUpon(Employee employee) {
        employee.performDuties();
    }
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github.domain;

public class EmergencyRoomProcess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HospitalManagement ERDirector = new HospitalManagement();
        Employee peggy = new Nurse(1, "Peggy", "Emergency", true);
        ERDirector.callUpon(peggy);

        Employee suzan = new Doctor(2, "Suzan", "Emergency", true);
        ERDirector.callUpon(suzan);
    }
}
```

- Now `HospitalManagement` Object has a lot less responsibility. It no longer needs to know the details of what a doctor does or what a nurse does.
- If more types of employees are added such as department managers or security guards they would all just do work as defined in their own class definitions and the specifics of their behavior will be no one's business.
- This system is now `open for extension` and `closed for modification`.
- You no longer have the need to modify the framework to support new employee responsibilities.

- This also could have been done using an **_Interface_** rather than making the Employee class **_Abstract_** and for that we could have define an **_Interface_** say EmployeeWork and added the perform duties behavior there and have all our employees implement that interface. Both approaches allow for abstraction and that's what this design principle is about. It makes the system more abstract to support extensibility.

- The refactoring we did to correct this design and get rid of all of those instance of occurrences happens to be a widely used design pattern in the industry. It's called the `Strategy Design Pattern`.

- This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
    - We encapsulated the details of work a particular kind of employee does.
    - Clients can now use a consistent **_Interface_** to tell employees to perform their respective responsibilities without getting into the details of what they are and how specific employees perform them.
    - A `Unit Test` written for let's say the `HospitalManagement` class would not require modification if we extended the system to support several different kinds of employees because all these employees would respond to the perform duties message.
