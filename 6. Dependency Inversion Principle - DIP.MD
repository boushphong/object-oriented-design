## Dependency Inversion Principle

Violations of DIP happens when higher level modules depend on lower level ones susceptible to change.

- Well designed software objects have single responsibily, so they would depend on other objects to get things done (assuming they are organized). If howevever, if unrelated objects get intertwined and become difficult to untie knots between objects. This is called `Tight Coupling`. To avoid this, it is recommended to follow SOLID principle.

### Dependency Inversion
- DIP states that Highlevel modules should not depend on Lowlevel modules. Both should depend on `Abstraction`. Abstraction should not depend on details and details should depend upon abstractions.

- We solved this in Part 5. by introducing abstraction.

```java
abstract public class Employee {
    abstract public void performDuties();
    
    // ...
}
```

- As children of the abstract `Employee` class it became compulsory for them to implement all abstract methods defined on the paired abstract class. So each kind of employee implemented its own version of **_performDuties_** (this is the details mention above) method whatever performing duties specifically meant for them. 
- Other classes could then depend on the abstract idea of employees working when sent the perform duties message.
- If the specific details of their work changed in let's say the doctor class or the nurse class the clients sending the perform duties message wouldn't know or care.

### Abstract Classes and Interfaces don't change as often as concrete derivatives (Classes that implement other Classes or Interfaces)
- Abstract classes and interfaces change far less than classes that extend and implement them abstract methods and interfaces define a contract that their derivatives must materialize and this contract is not meant to change often.

- However, it's totally OK to depend on concrete low-level classes as long as they don't change.
- For example:
  - Defining variables of type `String` is a ubiquitous dependency. I can go as far as saying pretty much all classes have a dependency on the `String` class but there is no harm in that because we can pretty much guarantee that the `String` class is not going to change in a way that would harm our objects that depend on its behavior.
