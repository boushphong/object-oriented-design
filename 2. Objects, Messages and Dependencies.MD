- Methods defined in a class definition, represent the **BEHAVIOUR** that instances of that calss will have during **RUNTIME**. This behaviour is invoked by sending **MESSAGES** to that Object.

- Objects carry out behaviour in response to messages they receive.

## Example
```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class Vehicle {
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Starting my engine");
    };

    public void stopEngine() {
        System.out.println("Stopping my engine");
    };

    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Accelerating myself ...");
    };

}
```
- Vehicle class has 3 behaviours. Vehecles will respond to these 3 messages (methods)

```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myCar = new Vehicle();
        Vehicle anotherCar = new Vehicle();

        myCar.accelerate();
        anotherCar.accelerate();
    }
}
```

- These Objects `myCar`, `anotherCar` are completely different from one another, and they are both capable of responding to the **_accelerate_** message.

- If a client tries to send for example an **_explode_** message to this vehicle. There is nothing to worry about because this vehicle is not even capable of conducting that kind of behavior. 
- The explode method here is not defined on the class so it's not going to even respond to the message. In other word, it's not even capable of responding to such a message.

## Thinking in terms of objects and messages helps better understand software behavior during runtime.

#### Adding another Driver class
```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class Driver {
    public void drive(Vehicle raceCar) {
        raceCar.accelerate();
    }
}
```

- This would allow all `Driver` objects the capability to be able to respond to the **_drive_** message when the driver sends the Accelerate message to the vehicle object when it's getting this vehicle object as part of the parameter.
- Objects can have dependencies.
    - A `Driver` object would need a `Vehicle` object to be able to drive. The driver depends on a vehicle object to be handed to him as part of the parameter to the drive method. Only then can he(the driver) behave like he is supposed to and drive.
    - In reality, a driver needs a vehical to be able to perform certain behaviours (eg. **_accelerate_**)
    - This dependency that the `Driver` has on a `Vehicle` object is referred to as in **_ASSOCIATION_**
    - **_Associations_****** should always be organized around how the software will behave

## Associations
- Associations define a relationship between classes and there can be different kinds of associations

### Dependency Association
- The Example above is a `Dependency Association`.

The driver receives a vehicle reference only in the scope of the drive operation. So the driver is dependent on a vehicle object to be handed to it as a parameter to the drive operation. Only then can he perform the drive operation.

- The association is formed in terms of the scope of the operation not the class in general that's a `Dependency Association`.

### Composition Associations

- A particular object is composed of other objects that make up a whole.
- And if the containing object ceases to exist the internal parts it's composed of no longer exist either. (No Vehicle -> No Engine)

```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class Vehicle {
    Engine myEngine
    
    public Vehicle(Engine anEngine) {
        myEngine = anEngine;
    }

    public void operateVehicle() {
        myEngine.start()
    }
    // other methods hidden
}
```

- We have a vehicle class that is composed of an `Engine` object. If the vehicle ceases to exist so does the engine. It wouldn't make sense for an engine to be lurking around without a `Vehicle` object.
- So the engine only lives in the context of a `Vehicle` object.
- Composition implies ownership.

```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class SchoolLanguageDepartment {
    SpanishCourse spanish;
    FrenchCourse french;
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class SpanishCourse {
    Student[] student;
    ...
}
```

```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class FrenchCourse {
    Student[] student;
    ...
}
```
- If `School Language Department` closes down all of the courses that belong in that school department also ceased to exist. This is Composition Relationship.
- Hence, we could say `School Language Department` owns the Courses

### Aggregation Associations
- Aggregation association defers from ordinary compositions such that it does not imply ownership.

```java
public class Student {
    // implementation
}
```

In this case, The relationship of course and the student is an `Aggregation Relationship`.
- It does not imply ownership. A course does not own a student.
- So if a course is canceled or removed that doesn't mean that the student no longer exists within the application that student object can enroll for many other courses in many other departments.
- So in the running application, the `Student` object can still exist independent of the particular course as well as a particular department that closes down.
