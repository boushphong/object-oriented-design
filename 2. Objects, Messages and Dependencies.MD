- Methods defined in a class definition, represent the **BEHAVIOUR** that instances of that calss will have during **RUNTIME**. This behaviour is invoked by sending **MESSAGES** to that Object.

- Objects carry out behaviour in response to messages they receive.

## Example
```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class Vehicle {
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Starting my engine");
    };

    public void stopEngine() {
        System.out.println("Stopping my engine");
    };

    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Accelerating myself ...");
    };

}
```
- Vehicle class has 3 behaviours. Vehecles will respond to these 3 messages (methods)

```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myCar = new Vehicle();
        Vehicle anotherCar = new Vehicle();

        myCar.accelerate();
        anotherCar.accelerate();
    }
}
```

- These Objects `myCar`, `anotherCar` are completely different from one another, and they are both capable of responding to the **_accelerate_** message.

- If a client tries to send for example an **_explode_** message to this vehicle. There is nothing to worry about because this vehicle is not even capable of conducting that kind of behavior. 
- The explode method here is not defined on the class so it's not going to even respond to the message. In other word, it's not even capable of responding to such a message.

## Thinking in terms of objects and messages helps better understand software behavior during runtime.

#### Adding another Driver class
```java
package com.boushphong.github;

public class Driver {
    public void drive(Vehicle raceCar) {
        raceCar.accelerate();
    }
}
```

- This would allow all `Driver` objects the capability to be able to respond to the **_drive_** message when the driver sends the Accelerate message to the vehicle object when it's getting this vehicle object as part of the parameter.
- Objects can have dependencies.
    -  A `Driver` object would need a `Vehicle` object to be able to drive. The driver depends on a vehicle object to be handed to him as part of the parameter to the drive method. Only then can he behave like he is supposed to and drive.
    -  In reality, a driver needs a vehical to be able to perform certain behaviours (eg. **_accelerate_**)
