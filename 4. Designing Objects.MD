## Bad Design

This is because the methods seem not to be the natural behaviour of an employee. These behaviors and what of an actual employee would conduct, these methods seem like operations that can be performed on an employee rather than the employee objects. These methods should not be an employee's responsibility or concerns.

The problem with the design is that this `Employee` class is responsible for way too much and when classes stretch their scope of responsibility things seem out of place. Especially their behavior.

For eg: The first methods assume that the `Employee` Object knows how to save themselves to the database, which means the it should know the database's crendentials too.

A large system where we have hundreds of different kinds of objects. If each kind of object enforced its own rules about how it should be saved to the database and how its reports should be formatted the requirement from the business to change databases or standardize reporting across the application. That would be a nightmare for programmers.

Objects that have too much responsibility is a rigid and fragile design and their behavior is misaligned from the intent that that class was actually created for in the first place.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should only have a single reason to change.

Eg.:

- If the company's database implementation changes all such classes containing database code would need to be modified.

- Requirement changes for report formats may result in modifying both Somalia and CSP methods of this class.

This class is responsible for too many things. It's a big violater of the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

- These new classes are conforming to the `Single Responsibility Principle` and following SRP allows for proper `Separation Of Concerns`.

- The `Employee` object is no longer responsible for defining formatting rules or communicating with the database directly.
