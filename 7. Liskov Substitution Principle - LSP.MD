## Liskov Substitution Principle

- LSP simply states that subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- So basically you should design your classes so that the dependencies a client may have can be substituted with subclasses without the client being impacted or knowing about the change.

Recalling Chapter 5. Open Closed Principle
We changed the `Employee` class to be abstract and all subtypes of that class were required to implement the abstract performed duties method. This provided a tremendous amount of freedom for the client because it could now just call upon all employees to do work without knowing the details of their specific jobs.

Now this was only possible because the derivatives of the `Employee` class such as a `Doctor` or `Nurse` were genuinely employees. That is why they were inheriting from the parent employee class. Keep in mind that inheritance hierarchies should be based on the `IS A` relationship. a doctor **_is an_** employee. A nurse **_is an_** employee as well.

- This is basically the `Liskov Substitution Principle`

### Example

- In this logic, what if the `Substitude Teacher` is not allowed to teach (maybe monitoring students are their responsibility) . Teaching in this case is the responsibility of the main teacher.

- In this case, a violation of the `Liskov Substitution Principle` would be to have a substitute teacher or inherit from the teacher class because as as as for our definition, which means the `SubstituteTeacher` also have to implement the **_teach()_** method (like the diagram below). However in our logic, Substitute teachers don't actually teach. So this does not fall into this particular hierarchy because it is not really a teacher as per our definition.

#### Diagram B (Bad Design)
<img width="1106" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59940078/206226178-0ab0be52-b395-49a5-b5fc-040f03c49656.png">

We can however handle this probem by throwing a customer `CannotTeachException`. So we're actually throwing this cannot teach exception in the body of the teach method like so.

```java
public class CannotTeachException extends Exception {
    
}

```java
public class SubstitudeTeacher extends Teacher {
    @Override
    public void teach() {
        throw new CannotTeachException();
    }
}
```

This is **BAD** because we have to add the exception to the teacher class like so.

```java
public abstract class Teacher {
    public abstract void teach() throw CannotTeachException; // <- Forcing changes on parent class by having to add an exception here
    
    private void makeAnnoucements() {
        ...
    }
    
    ...
    
    public void performOtherResponsibilites() {
        makeAnnoucements();
        takeAttendence();
        ...
    }
    
}
```

- Now notice how the subclass is forcing change in its parent. Now in the definition of this abstract method we would actually have to throw the new exception. So this is unacceptable we should never force upon a parent class changes because things don't work out in the subclasses
- Throwing an exception like this is an `Anti-Pattern`.

### Solution
- The solution [Good Design](#diagram-A) to this whole mess would be to pull out a substitute teacher from this inheritance relationship because it simply is not a teacher as per our definition of what a teacher what a real teacher whose behavior should be.
- We broken out the responsibility of teaching to a particular interface called CourseInstructor and the general responsibilities that all high school staff members should have is encapsulated in the `SchoolStaff` abstract class.

in this school staff abstract class.

```java
public class SchoolStaff {
    private void makeAnnouncements() {
        System.out.println("made announcements..");
    }
    private void takeAttendence() {
        System.out.println("took attendence..");
    }
    private void  collectPaperWork() {
        System.out.println("collected paperwork..");
    }
    private void  conductHallwayDuties() {
        System.out.println("conducted hallway duties..");
    }

    public void  performOtherResponsibilities() {
        makeAnnouncements();
        takeAttendence();
        collectPaperWork();
        conductHallwayDuties();
        performOtherResponsibilities();
    }
}
```

```java
public interface CourseInstructor {
    public void teach();
}
```

```java
public class EnglishTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements CourseInstructor {

    @Override
    public void teach() {
        System.out.println("Taught English");
    }
}
```

```java
public class MathTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements CourseInstructor {

    @Override
    public void teach() {
        System.out.println("Taught Math");
    }
}
```

```java
public class ScienceTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements CourseInstructor {

    @Override
    public void teach() {
        System.out.println("taught science");
    }
}
```

```java
public class SubstituteTeacher extends SchoolStaff {

}
```

- This design is now conforming with the `Liskov Substitution Principle` Asper our definition of what our teacher is we have separated that behavior into an interface called course and structure with one method teach and all the real teachers.
- `SubstituteTeacher` extends the `SchoolStaff` Abstract Class since they are also staffs. But it does not implements the `CourseInstructor` interface, which means they don't teach. They are just school staff members.

## Key Takeaway
The key takeaway in this lesson is that subclasses should be substitutable for their base class. Otherwise you have a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.

You know you are violating LSP when it doesn't quite make sense for a method to be called on the subclass object.

In our example a substitute was not really a teacher it didn't make sense for us to be calling the teach method on that object.
