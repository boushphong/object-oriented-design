## Liskov Substitution Principle

- LSP simply states that subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    - If `A` is a SubType of `B`, then wherever an object of class `B` is expected, an object of class `A` can be used instead without breaking the program.
- So basically you should design your classes so that the dependencies a client may have can be substituted with subclasses without the client being impacted or knowing about the change.

Recalling Chapter 5. Open Closed Principle
We changed the `Employee` class to be abstract and all subtypes of that class were required to implement the abstract performed duties method. This provided a tremendous amount of freedom for the client because it could now just call upon all employees to do work without knowing the details of their specific jobs.

Now this was only possible because the derivatives of the `Employee` class such as a `Doctor` or `Nurse` were genuinely employees. That is why they were inheriting from the parent employee class. Keep in mind that inheritance hierarchies should be based on the `IS A` relationship. a doctor **_is an_** employee. A nurse **_is an_** employee as well.

- This is basically the `Liskov Substitution Principle`





## Key Takeaway
The key takeaway in this lesson is that subclasses should be substitutable for their base class. Otherwise you have a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.

You know you are violating LSP when it doesn't quite make sense for a method to be called on the subclass object.

In our example a substitute was not really a teacher it didn't make sense for us to be calling the teach method on that object.
