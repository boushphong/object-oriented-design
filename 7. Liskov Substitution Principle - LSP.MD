## Liskov Substitution Principle

- LSP simply states that subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    - If `A` is a SubType of `B`, then wherever an object of class `B` is expected, an object of class `A` can be used instead without breaking the program.
- So basically you should design your classes so that the dependencies a client may have can be substituted with subclasses without the client being impacted or knowing about the change.

Recalling Chapter 5. Open Closed Principle
We changed the `Employee` class to be abstract and all subtypes of that class were required to implement the abstract performed duties method. This provided a tremendous amount of freedom for the client because it could now just call upon all employees to do work without knowing the details of their specific jobs.

Now this was only possible because the derivatives of the `Employee` class such as a `Doctor` or `Nurse` were genuinely employees. That is why they were inheriting from the parent employee class. Keep in mind that inheritance hierarchies should be based on the `IS A` relationship. a doctor **_is an_** employee. A nurse **_is an_** employee as well. 

For example, now we would have `Veterinarian` class that inherits (extends) `Doctor` (Veterinarian is also a doctor who performs on animals), then `Veterinarian` is a SubType of `Doctor`, then wherever an object of class `Veterinarian` is expected, an object of class `Veterinarian` can be used instead without breaking the program.

- This is basically the `Liskov Substitution Principle`

### Example

```java
// Shape is a superclass that defines a method for calculating the area of a shape
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea();
}

// Rectangle is a subclass of Shape that overrides the calculateArea() method
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

// Square is a subclass of Rectangle that also overrides the calculateArea() method
class Square extends Rectangle {
    public Square(double side) {
        super(side, side);
    }

    public double calculateArea() {
        return super.calculateArea();
    }
}

// Here we have a function that takes a Shape object and calculates its area
public static void printArea(Shape shape) {
    System.out.println("Area: " + shape.calculateArea());
}

// We can use the function with both Rectangle and Square objects, since Square is a subtype of Rectangle
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
    Square square = new Square(5);
    printArea(rect); // prints "Area: 50.0"
    printArea(square); // prints "Area: 25.0"
}
```

In this example, we have an interface `Shape` that defines a method `calculateArea()`. We also have two classes `Rectangle` and `Circle` that implement the `Shape` interface and provide their own implementation for the `calculateArea()` method.

The `printArea()` method takes a `Shape` object as a parameter, which allows it to work with any object that implements the `Shape` interface. We can use the method with both `Rectangle` and `Circle` objects, since they both implement the `Shape` interface.

## Key Takeaway
The key takeaway in this lesson is that subclasses should be substitutable for their base class. Otherwise you have a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.

You know you are violating LSP when it doesn't quite make sense for a method to be called on the subclass object.
